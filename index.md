My name is Deborah Allen.  I have end stage renal disease due to a rare disease that’s attacking my kidneys.  I’ve been on dialysis every night since February, 2019.

If you would like to be tested to donate go to: [nmlivingdonor.org](http://nmlivingdonor.org) and fill out the online questionnaire.

Although I’m glad this is an option to keep me alive to be here for my kids, dialysis only performs a small percentage of my original kidney function and there are side effects.  I am currently on the list for transplant with Northwestern Memorial Hospital where the wait is 5 to 7 years.

I am actively seeking a living donor because the longer I stay on dialysis, the sicker I will become.  Also, my best chance for a successful transplant comes with a living donor kidney.  

Northwestern has told me that it will be hard to find a comparable donor and I’ve had several people test for me who are not a match.  I’m looking for people who have type O blood and would be willing to test and see if they might be compatible to give me their spare kidney.
